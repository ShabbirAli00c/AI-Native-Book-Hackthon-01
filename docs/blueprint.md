- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#4B0082) to convey intelligence and depth. It's a versatile color that implies a sense of knowledge.
- Background color: Very light Lavender (#F0F8FF). This provides a subtle, desaturated backdrop that doesn't distract from the content but remains visually cohesive with the primary color.

- Body and headline font: 'Inter', sans-serif, for a modern and neutral look suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying code snippets.
- Use a consistent set of professional, minimalist icons throughout the platform. Icons should be easily recognizable and related to book content or user actions.
- Design a clean and professional SaaS UI with clear sections, authentication-aware navigation, and responsive design.
- Implement subtle animations, like loading spinners or fade-in effects, to enhance the user experience without being intrusive.
